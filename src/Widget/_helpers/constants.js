At my time 63 students opted and I was afraid that, I will be dropped because of the mischievous things I did.One day principal came to my class and made all boys stood up and I started shivering not because of him, because I will be dropped. He came to me and said all the boys to sit down except me and said you will be lead for boys. We have covered so many places and had lots of fun. I was speechless when Taj Mahal was right infront of me.It is rightly called one of wonders of the world. It was a memorable Trip. Though the return journey was filled with bit of sadness, It was memorable trip to cherish. It was 8 great days of my school life.',

Fortunately or unfortunately, We got 2 cars only for 19 people and somehow managed.There are 2 ways to reach Kattika waterfalls. One from behind borra caves and the other by trekking down. So which one we would go? Of course , It is trek down. We had a wonderful and scary time. scary because if we slip or had a wrong step we would fell in deep steep.Next is Yarada beach, rather than beach going there is more fun if you made someone who fears a lot sits beside driver seat. It was really fun. Playing Kabadi in RK beach at midnight, early morning sun-rise everything is good.',

Ride from Mysore to Ooty has lots of cross hair-pins, driving through forest able to see wild life animals, makes the ride good. Be careful rented bike is not allowed. I didn't get a chance to ride car again. We have visited various places in ooty and coonor some are Ooty lake,tea estate and pykara waterfalls. Green tea prepared by them is awesome, You will love to drink from then. We cooked food. P.S. Food outside is not that great if you eat spicy daily.",

It doesn't matter whatever the place, you will just enjoy it.I joined in Hyderabad with them with their favorite biryani's. We took a zoom car from Pune to Lonavala. Loghard Fort trek which is 1,033 m above sea level and had hard time climbing up the view made all the pain go away in a second. Such a beautiful place. You can see the reverse waterfall, more generally to say waterfall which throws water up because of the air force. The one and only disappointment in the trip is I missed Rajmachi Trek which is above 826m.",

Feared that my trip might get effected luckly nothing happened. Booked a car with driver since the road to Joshimath is very narrow and small mistake can cause life. We managed to go joshimath in 16hrs without sleep. Form Joshimath to Auli go by car until 8th tower and then go by chair car,unlike from 1st tower you can feel the cool breeze. Auli has a wonderful viewpoints, good place to have your DP. You can do snow skiing in Auli. Tungnath trek is the hardest one we had with 3680m above sea level. If you have breathing problem better carry a mini oxygen tank. One of my friend had a problem and couldn't make it to top. Next thought an easy one,river rafting and clif jumping and no one knows how to swim. Faced the fear and made it successful. Tried for bungie jump couldn't find slots, needs to be booked before only as they are limited.",

I dont know why I choose Manchester United at that time after reading about the club history, I feel I made right choice. Ever since I am fan of Manchester United, will be to the end of life. Strength of the club is the presence of a big fan base, Attacking play,counter-attacks which makes fan goes crazy. It doesnt matter if you win or lose as long as you can make fans happy.I can go on talking about the club if I start, So lets end it here.'

It is so motivational that whenever I feel deperesed I watch these to get back. I will make my kids watch this for sure. They need to know what friendship, sacrifice, hardwork is capable of. I know how much naruto has changed my life."
